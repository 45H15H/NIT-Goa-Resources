Develop a C program that writes the contents of one or more files in succession 
to standard output. (That is, the program writes the concatenation of a number of 
files  to  standard  output.)  The  sequence  of  files  to  be  processed  should  be 
specified  as  command-line  arguments  (i.e.,  via  the  arguments  passed  to  the 
main function).
