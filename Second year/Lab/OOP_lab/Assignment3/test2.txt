Write  a  C++  function  copy_ints  that  copies  a  specified  number  of  ints  from  one 
memory  area  to  another.  The  function  should  have  a  void  return  type  and  take 
the following parameters: 1) a pointer specifying the start of the source area for 
the copy operation; 2) an integral type specifying how many ints to copy, and 3) a 
pointer  specifying  the  start  of  the  destination  area  for  the  copy  operation.  Test 
the function writing main function.
